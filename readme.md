Points and Vectors
****
Points: 
    - Represent Location
    - Written as (x, y, z)
Vectors: 
    - Represent change in location
    - Magnitude and Direction
    - Written as [x
                  y
                  z]
Operating on Vectors: 
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Scalar Multiplication
    
Magnitude and Direction:
    - Magnitude of a vector refers to how much movement it quantifies
    - Direction of a vector refers to where the director's movement is pointed.
    - A unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is 1. 
    - A vector's direction can be represented by a unit vector.
    - Normialization is a process of finding a unit vector in the same direction a s given vector. a/[a]

How about multiplying two vectors?
Inner Products: 
    - It lets us find the angle between two vectors
    - a.b = |a|*|b|*cos(0)
    - It results a number not a vector
    - 1 <= cos(0)<=1
    - Cauchy Schwarz Inequality
        - a.b <= |a].|b|
